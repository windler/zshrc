# .zshrc enhancements
This is the `oh-my-zsh` configuration I use. It basically sets the theme, plugins and some aliases.

## Installation
In order to install you need `oh-my-zsh`. Then you can install the config doing the following:


```
cd ~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/
git clone https://github.com/windler/zsh-phpunit-docker.git .
zsh
```

## Preconditions
The used theme needs special fonts. You may install PowerlineFonts (https://github.com/powerline/fonts).
